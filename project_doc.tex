Project Description: 
We are creating a 2 player game to simulate a game of badminton.
W, A, S, D for Player 1 and UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT for Player 2.
Press R to restart the game after a player has won.
W and UP are to jump.
D and DOWN are to swing.
A, LEFT are to move left.
D, RIGHT are to move right.
The first player to get 7 points win. 
The only rule is do not let the birdie touch the floor on your side of the net. 

Functionalities:
* Player1 and Player2 can walk left, right, and jump
* Players cannot move past the net or off the screen
* Both the player and birdie are affected by gravity and gradually move down when in the air
* Rackets can swing
* Rackets can smash the birdie if hit at a certain angle
* Score board is displayed at the top of the screen
* There is an end screen when a player reaches 7 points declaring who won
* The birdie resets at a certain position after a point is won
* The birdie, net, and racket have hit detection to win points
* The birdie bounces off the wall if it is about to go off the screen

Comments:
Hit detection may be a little off, but that is because of the frame rate anticipating the birdie too early!
